        <h4>Recipe Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix brown sugar, mustard, and soy sauce together in a bowl. Measure 1/4 cup marinade for basting and transfer to a small bowl; cover and refrigerate.</li>

            <li>Remove chicken wings from resealable bag and transfer to a baking sheet. Discard marinade.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Baste wings with reserved 1/4 cup marinade; cook, basting every 10 minutes, until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 30 more minutes.</li>
