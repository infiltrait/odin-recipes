            <li>1 medium onion (about 1 cup), chopped</li>
            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon coriander</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon Morton kosher salt (maybe more)</li>

        <h4>Recipe Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F</li>
            <li>Cook the onions and beef:</li>
            <p>Heat the olive oil in a medium nonstick or cast iron skillet, and cook the onions for 5 minutes until they start to soften.</p>
            <p>Add the beef, chili powder, coriander, oregano and kosher salt. Break the beef up with a wooden spoon and cook until it browns, about 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside.</p>
            <li>Line the pan with tortilla chips:</li>
            <p>This is not an exact science—I probably used 6 to 8 handfuls of tortilla chips to line the sheet pan. You want them close and touching and mostly in one layer, but not too high.</p>
            <li>Add the beef:</li>
            <p>Using a slotted spoon to drain off the fat, transfer the beef to the pan with the chips, scattering it evenly across the pan. Be generous—you will use it all up.</p>
            <li>Add the toppings:</li>
            <p>Add the bell pepper, black beans, corn, black olives, and cheese.</p>
            <li>Bake the nachos:</li>
            <p>Bake the nachos in the oven for about 5 to 7 minutes, or until the cheese melts and becomes bubbly.</p>
            <li>Make the cilantro lime crème:</li>
            <p>While the nachos bake, place the sour cream, lime, cilantro, and salt into the bowl of a food processor fitted with the blade. Process until the ingredients become smooth and there are no lumps. Taste and add more salt if necessary.</p>
            <p>If you don't want to bother with your food processor, you could finely chop the cilantro and stir it into the sour cream with the lime juice and salt.</p>
        </ol>
